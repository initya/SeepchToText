# SeepchToText
This Python code is a simple example of using the SpeechRecognition library to perform speech recognition using the Google Speech Recognition API. You can use this code to capture audio from a microphone and then transcribe the spoken words into text using Google's speech recognition service.


Here's a breakdown of the code:

Importing the necessary library:

####python

import speech_recognition as sr
This line imports the SpeechRecognition library and renames it as sr for convenience.

Initializing the recognizer:

####python

r = sr.Recognizer()
The code creates a Recognizer object from the SpeechRecognition library, which will be used to recognize speech.

Recording audio from the microphone:

####python

with sr.Microphone() as source:
    print("Speak Anything : ")
    audio = r.listen(source)
This section uses a with statement to open a microphone as a source for audio input. The user is prompted to speak, and the listen method of the recognizer is used to capture the audio.

Speech recognition using Google Speech Recognition:

####python

try:
    print("You said : " + r.recognize_google(audio))
except sr.UnknownValueError:
    print("Google Speech Recognition could not understand audio")
except sr.RequestError as e:
    print("Could not request results from Google Speech Recognition service; {0}".format(e))
    
This part of the code attempts to recognize the speech using Google's Speech Recognition API. The recognized text is printed if successful. If the API fails to understand the audio (sr.UnknownValueError), an appropriate message is printed. If there is an issue with the API request (sr.RequestError), an error message is printed.

You can use this code as a starting point for voice-controlled applications or any project that involves converting spoken words into text. To include it in a GitHub README file, you might want to provide instructions on how to install the required library (speech_recognition) and any additional setup steps (such as installing necessary dependencies). Additionally, you could include information on how users can modify or extend the code for their specific needs.
